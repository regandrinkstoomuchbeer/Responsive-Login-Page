# Responsive-Login-Page

The reponsive login page was made out of HTML form,a bit of Javascript (onclick),CSS with the use of (CSS) webkit linear gradient to mash up different colours to give a unique fusion of colours to create an attaractive login page. 

I used the oncick event attribute in the HTML to distinguish between the login and the signup button. We use (HTML DOM style),  margin.left to execute the login and use a retun false when click on the signup which the right side of the element, so if not left, returns false to the right side of the element.
